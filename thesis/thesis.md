# Introduction

# Methodology and Implementation

# Extraction

## Backchannel selection

list of 200 most common BCs...

## Prediction outputs

- expect `1` shortly before BC, `0` 2 seconds earlier
- bell curve

# Training

## Feed forward


## RNN / LSTM

# Postprocessing

low-pass filter, trigger BC at maxima

use random BC sample from training data

# Evaluation

# Future Work

predict specific BCs / categories
